# PredatorPreyTutorial
A short tutorial on how to implement a predator-prey model and analyse the data in Julia. Mainly using Agents.jl and AgentsX.jl repositories.

*This tutorial will be delivered at the Social Simulation Conference 2022 in Milan, Italy.*

#### Abstract


**A Speedy Implementation of a Predator-Prey Model in Julia**

This tutorial will showcase how to set up a Predator-Prey model in Julia with minimal effort and time.

In an ABM, we conceive the idea of an Agent as an abstraction of the real world. These abstractions usually involve spatial and non-spatial components. This tutorial will focus on how to translate our abstract Agents into concrete Agents in Julia. After this tutorial, you will be able to quickly prototype an Agent-Based Modelling environment in Julia, consisting of heterogenous agents who interact in a 2D space. Further, you will gain knowledge on connecting peripheral packages in Julia to explore and analyse the data output by the ABM.

For this workshop, no prior knowledge of Julia is expected. Basic programming skills and a fundamental understanding of ABMs will be beneficial.
